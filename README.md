## 树

### 二叉树

Each node has a maximum of two leaf nodes.
*  [《二叉树》](https://blog.csdn.net/cai2016/article/details/52589952)

### Completely Two-Chain
* ["Complete Binary Tree"] (https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E4%BA%8C%E5%8F%89%E6%A0%91 /7773232?fr=aladdin)
	* Leaf nodes can only appear in the lowermost and lower lower layers, and the nodes in the lowermost layer are concentrated in the binary tree at the leftmost position of the layer.

### Balanced binary tree
The absolute difference between the height difference between the two subtrees does not exceed 1, and the two subtrees are both balanced binary trees.
* ["On Data Structure - Balanced Binary Tree"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/polly333/p/4798944.html)
* ["On Algorithms and Data Structures: 2-3 Trees in Eight Balanced Lookup Trees"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-2-3-Search-Tree.html)

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
Binary Search Tree, also known as ordered binary tree, sorted binary tree.

* ["About Algorithms and Data Structures: Seven-Dimensional Search Tree"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-Binary-Search-Tree.html)


### 红黑树
* ["The easiest to understand red-black tree"] (https://blog.csdn.net/sun_tttt/article/details/65445754)
	* After the addition phase, left-hand or right-handed to reach equilibrium again. 
* ["On Algorithms and Data Structures: The Red Black Tree of the Nine Balanced Search Tree"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-Red-Black-Tree.html)

### B,B+,B* tree
MySQL is based on B+ tree clustered index organization table

* ["B-Tree, B+ Tree, B\* Tree Detailed"] (https://blog.csdn.net/aqzwss/article/details/53074186)
* ["B-tree, B+ tree and B\* tree advantages and disadvantages comparison"] (https://blog.csdn.net/bigtree_3721/article/details/73632405)
	* The leaf node list structure of the B+ tree is easier to scan than the B-tree, and the range is retrieved.
### LSM Tree

Compared with the B+ tree, LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Trees) sacrifices the performance of partial reads in exchange for write performance (by batch writing) to achieve a balance between read and write.
Hbase, LevelDB, Tair (Long DB), and nessDB use the structure of the LSM tree. LSM can quickly build an index.

* ["LSM Tree VS B+ Tree"] (https://blog.csdn.net/dbanote/article/details/8897599)
	* B+ tree read performance is good, but due to the need for an ordered structure, when the keys are scattered, the disk seeks frequently, resulting in poor write performance.
	* LSM is to split a big tree into N small trees, first write to memory (no seek problem, high performance), build an ordered small tree (ordered tree) in memory, with the small tree The bigger the memory, the smaller the tree will be flushed to disk. When reading, because you don't know which tree the data is on, you must traverse (two points to find) all the small trees, but the data inside each small tree is ordered.
	
* ["LS-Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree) Storage Engine]] (https://blog.csdn.net/u014774781/article/details/52105708)
	* Extremely speaking, HBase's write performance based on LSM trees is an order of magnitude higher than MySQL, and read performance is an order of magnitude lower.
	* Optimization: Bloom filter replaces binary search; compact decimal tree to improve query performance.
	* In Hbase, after a certain threshold is reached in memory, the whole flush is on the disk to form a file (B+ number). HDFS does not support the update operation, so Hbase does the overall flush instead of the merge update. Flush to a small tree on disk, periodically merged into a big tree.

## BitSet

Often used for heavy-duty inspection of large-scale data.

## Sorting, Finding Algorithm

* ["Common Sorting Algorithms and Corresponding Time Complexity and Spatial Complexity"] (https://blog.csdn.net/gane_cheng/article/details/52652705)

### Select Sort
* ["Selection Sorting of Classic Algorithms in Java"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/shen-hua/p/5424059.html)
	* Each time selects the smallest element from the records to be sorted, and the order is placed at the end of the sorted sequence until all the records are sorted.

### Bubble Sort
* ["Two ways to write bubbles"] (https://blog.csdn.net/shuaizai88/article/details/73250615)
	* Adjacent elements are exchanged before and after, and the largest is discharged to the end.
	* Time complexity O(n2) 

### Insert sort
* ["Sorting Algorithm for Sorting Algorithm Summary"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/5517667.html)

### Quick Sort
* ["Sitting on the toilet to see the algorithm: quick sorting"] (http://developer.51cto.com/art/201403/430986.htm)
	* One side is larger or smaller than the other side. 
### Collapse sort
* ["Graphical Sorting Algorithm (4) Merging and Sorting]] (http://www.cnblogs.com/chengxiao/p/6194356.html)
	* Divide and conquer, divide into small parts, and merge (reconstruct a new space for copying). 

### Hill Sorting
ALL

### heap sorting
* ["Graphical Sorting Algorithm (3) Heap Sorting]] (https://www.cnblogs.com/chengxiao/p/6129630.html)
	* The sorting process is the process of building the largest heap. The maximum heap: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its left and right child nodes, and the top element is the maximum value.

### Counting sort
* ["Count Sorting and Bucket Sorting"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/suvllian/p/5495780.html)
	* Compared with the bucket sorting process, the difference is the number of buckets.

### Bucket sorting
* ["[Aha! Algorithm] the fastest and simplest sorting - bucket sorting]] (http://blog.51cto.com/ahalei/1362789)
* ["Sorting Algorithm (3): Count Sorting and Bucket Sorting]] (https://blog.csdn.net/sunjinshengli/article/details/70738527)
	* Bucket sorting divides the [0,1) interval into n sub-intervals of the same size, which are called buckets.
	* Each bucket is sorted separately, and then each bucket is traversed.

### Cardinal sorting

According to the position, ten, hundred, ... in order.

* ["Sorting Algorithm Series: Cardinality Sorting"] (https://blog.csdn.net/lemon_tree12138/article/details/51695211)
* ["Base Sorting"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/skywang12345/p/3603669.html)


### 二分找
* ["Two-point search (java implementation)"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/coderising/p/5708632.html)
	* Requires ordered sequences to be searched.
	* Time complexity O (logN).

* ["java realizes two-point search - two ways"] (https://blog.csdn.net/maoyuanming0806/article/details/78176957)
	* while + recursion.
### Sorting tools in Java
* ["Arrays.sort and Collections.sort implementation principle analysis"] (https://blog.csdn.net/u011410529/article/details/56668545?locationnum=6&fps=1)
	* The Collections.sort algorithm calls the merge sort.
	* Arrays.sort() uses two sorting algorithms -- basic type data using quick sorting, and object arrays using merge sorting.

## Bloom filter

Often used for big data weighting, such as email, url, etc.
Core principle: Each piece of data is calculated to produce a fingerprint (one byte or more bytes, but it must be much less than the original data), each of which is obtained by random calculation, mapping the fingerprint to a large The bitwise storage space. Note: There will be a certain error rate.
Advantages: Both space and time efficiency are high.
Disadvantages: As the number of elements deposited increases, the rate of miscalculation increases.

## string comparison

### KMP Algorithm
KMP: Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm (KMP for short)
The core principle is to use a "partial match table" to skip elements that have already been matched.

## consistency, transaction

### Transaction ACID Features
* ["Database ACID Features"] (https://blog.csdn.net/u012440687/article/details/52116108)

### The isolation level of the transaction

* Uncommitted read: A transaction can read another uncommitted data, which is prone to dirty reads.
* Read commit: A transaction can be read after another transaction is committed, but there will be cases where it is not repeatable (the data read multiple times is inconsistent), and there will be more UPDATE operations during the read process. (Most database default level is RC, such as SQL Server, Oracle), can not be modified when reading.
* Repeatable reads: Ensure that the same data is obtained for each read in the same transaction, but the original data is not guaranteed to be updated by other transactions (phantom read), which is the level of Mysql InnoDB.
* Serialization: serial processing of all things (at the expense of efficiency)

* ["Understanding the four isolation levels of the transaction"] (https://blog.csdn.net/qq_33290787/article/details/51924963)
* [Four characteristics of database transactions and transaction isolation level] (https://www.cnblogs.com/z-sm/p/7245981.html)

* ["MySQL's InnoDB phantom reading problem"] (http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_499740cb0100ugs7.html)
	* The example of phantom reading is very clear.
	* Resolved by SELECT ... FOR UPDATE.
	
* ["An article takes you to read MySQL and InnoDB"] (https://draveness.me/mysql-innodb)
	* Graphical dirty reading, non-repeatable reading, phantom reading problems.


### MVCC


* ["[mysql] some understanding of MVCC in innodb"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/chenpingzhao/p/5065316.html)
	* MVCC in innodb is used at the Repeatable-Read isolation level.
	* MVCC will produce a phantom read problem (an exception when updating.)

* ["Easy to understand MYSQL MVCC implementation mechanism"] (https://blog.csdn.net/whoamiyang/article/details/51901888)

	* MVCC control by hiding the version column, a list of record creation time, a list of record deletion time, time here
	* Only operate lines that are smaller (or equal) than the current version at a time.
	


## lock

### Lock and synchronization classes in Java

* ["Lock Classification in Java"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/qifengshi/p/6831055.html)
	* Mainly includes synchronized, ReentrantLock, and ReadWriteLock. 

* ["Java AQS Detailed Explanation"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/waterystone/p/4920797.html)

* ["Semaphore in Java"] (http://cuisuqiang.iteye.com/blog/2020146)
	* There is quantity control
	* Apply with acquire, do not block when applying; release with release.

* ["Mutex vs Semaphore in Java Development"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/davidwang456/p/6094947.html)
	* Simply put, Mutex is exclusive, only one can get resources, Semaphore is also exclusive, but can define multiple objects that can be obtained.	 

### Fair Lock & Unfair Lock

The role of the fair lock is to strictly follow the order in which the threads are started, and other threads are not allowed to execute in the queue; non-fair locks are allowed to cut the queue.

* ["Fair Lock and Unfair Lock"] (https://blog.csdn.net/EthanWhite/article/details/55508357)
	* By default ReentrantLock and synchronized are unfair locks. ReentrantLock can be set to a fair lock.

### pessimistic lock 

If the pessimistic lock is used improperly (the number of locks is too large), it will cause the service to wait for a large area. It is recommended to use optimistic lock + retry first.

* [[MySQL] Pessimistic Lock & Optimistic Lock] (https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiqian-ali/p/6200874.html)
	* Optimistic lock mode: version number + retry mode
	* Pessimistic lock: row lock by select ... for update (unreadable, not writable, share lock readable and unwritable).

* ["Mysql query statement using database. Deadlock analysis caused by select.. for update"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/Lawson/p/5008741.html)
	* mysql's innodb storage engine practice lock is a lock line, but it is internally locked index.
	* Different index conditions that lock the same data can cause deadlocks.
	
* ["Mysql concurrency classic common deadlock reasons and solutions"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/zejin2008/p/5262751.html)

### Optimistic Lock & CAS

* ["An Implementation of Optimistic Lock - CAS"] (http://www.importnew.com/20472.html)
	* Similar to MySQL optimistic locking, except that it is compared to the original value.	 

### ABA problem

Due to high concurrency, under CAS, this may be A after the update. It can be solved by the version number, similar to the optimistic lock mentioned in Mysql above.

* ["Java CAS and ABA Issues"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/549294286/p/3766717.html)
* ["ABA Problems and Avoidance in Java"] (https://blog.csdn.net/li954644351/article/details/50511879)
	* AtomicStampedReference 和 AtomicStampedReference。 

### CopyOnWrite container

Concurrent reads can be made to the CopyOnWrite container without the need for a lock. The CopyOnWrite concurrent container is used to read concurrent scenes with less writes. For example, whitelists, blacklists, product category access and update scenarios are not suitable for scenarios that require strong data consistency.

* ["Copy-On-Write Map Implementation in JAVA"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/4840107.html)
	* Implement read-write separation, read occurs on the original data, and writes occur on the copy.  
	* Consistently achieve consistency by not locking.
	
* ["Talk about Concurrency - Copy-On-Write Container in Java"] (https://blog.csdn.net/a494303877/article/details/53404623)

### RingBuffer 
* ["Thread-safe lock-free RingBuffer implementation [a read thread, a write thread]"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/l00l/p/4115001.html)

### Reentrant lock & non-reentrant lock

* ["Reentrant lock and non-reentrant lock"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/dj3839/p/6580765.html)
	* Illustrate reentrant locks and non-reentrant locks with simple code examples.
	* Reentrant lock means that the same thread can get the lock that has been obtained before.
	* Reentrant lock allows users to avoid deadlocks.
	* Reentrant locks in Java: synchronized and java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock

* ["ReenTrantLock reentrant lock (synchronized difference) summary]] (https://www.cnblogs.com/baizhanshi/p/7211802.html)
	* synchronized is easy to use, the compiler to lock, is an unfair lock.
	* ReenTrantLock is flexible and lock fairness can be customized.
	* Synchronized is recommended in the same locked scenario.

### Mutex & Shared Lock

Mutex: Only one thread can acquire a lock at a time. For example, ReentrantLock is a mutex and write locks in ReadWriteLock are mutex locks.
Shared lock: There can be multiple threads simultaneously or locked. For example, Semaphore, CountDownLatch are shared locks, and read locks in ReadWriteLock are shared locks.

* ["ReadWriteLock Scene Application"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/liang1101/p/6475555.html)

## CPU

### Multi-level cache
A typical CPU has a three-level cache. The closer to the core, the faster the speed and the smaller the space. L1 is generally 32k, L2 is generally 256k, and L3 is generally 12M. The memory speed requires 200 CPU cycles and the CPU cache requires 1 CPU cycle.

	* The scheduling of threads is the responsibility of the operating system, and the scheduling is the responsibility of the program itself.
	* Compared to threads, coroutines reduce unnecessary operating system switching.
	* In fact, it makes more sense to switch when encountering IO operations (because IO operations do not take up CPU), if you do not encounter IO operations, switch according to time slices.

# Design Patterns

## The six principles of design patterns
* ["The Six Principles of Design Patterns"] (https://blog.csdn.net/q291611265/article/details/48465113)
	* Open and close principles: open to extensions, close to modifications, use abstract classes and interfaces.
	* The principle of Richter substitution: base classes can be replaced by subclasses, using abstract class inheritance, without concrete class inheritance.
	* Dependency reversal principle: rely on abstraction, do not rely on specific, for interface programming, not for implementation programming.
	* Interface isolation principle: Using multiple isolated interfaces is better than using a single interface to establish a minimum interface.
	* Dimitt's Law: A software entity should interact with other entities as little as possible to establish contact through intermediate classes.
	* Synthetic reuse principle: Try to use synthesis/aggregation instead of inheritance.

## 23 common design patterns
* [Design Patterns] (http://www.runoob.com/design-pattern/design-pattern-tutorial.html)
* ["Comprehension of 23 Design Patterns"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/susanws/p/5510229.html)
* [Design Pattern Class Diagram and Examples] (https://github.com/ToryZhou/design-pattern)

## Application Scenario
* ["Detailed Design Patterns in JDK"] (http://blog.jobbole.com/62314/)
	* Structured mode:
		* Adapter: Used to convert an interface into another interface, such as java.util.Arrays#asList().
		* Bridge mode: This mode decouples the implementation of abstraction and abstract operations so that abstractions and implementations can be changed independently, such as JDBC;
		* Combination mode: Makes the client see that the combination of a single object and an object is equivalent. In other words, a type of method also accepts its own type as a parameter, such as Map.putAll, List.addAll, Set.addAll.
		* Decorator mode: Dynamically attaching additional functionality to an object, which is an alternative to subclasses, such as java.util.Collections#checkedList|Map|Set|SortedSet|SortedMap.
		* Flyweight mode: Use the cache to speed up the access time of a large number of small objects, such as valueOf(int).
		* Proxy mode: Proxy mode is to replace a complex or create time-consuming object with a simple object, such as java.lang.reflect.Proxy
		
	* Create mode:
		* Abstract factory pattern: The abstract factory pattern provides a protocol to generate a series of related or independent objects without specifying the type of the concrete object, such as java.util.Calendar#getInstance().
		* Builder: Defines a new class to build an instance of another class to simplify the creation of complex objects such as java.lang.StringBuilder#append().
		* Factory method: ** A method to return to a specific object instead of multiple, such as java.lang.Object#toString(), java.lang.Class#newInstance().
		* Prototype mode: Enables an instance of a class to generate its own copy, such as: java.lang.Object#clone().
		* Singleton mode: There is only one instance globally, such as java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime().
	* Behavior mode:
		* Chain of Responsibility: Decoupling between objects by passing the request from one object to the next in the chain until the request is processed. Such as javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter().
		* Command mode: Encapsulate operations into objects for storage, delivery, and return, such as java.lang.Runnable.
		* Interpreter mode: defines the syntax of a language, and then parses the corresponding syntax of the statement, such as java.text.Format, java.text.Normalizer.
		* Iterator pattern: Provides a consistent way to sequentially access objects in the collection, such as java.util.Iterator.
		* Mediator mode: By using an intermediate object for message distribution and reducing direct dependencies between classes, java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke().
		* Empty object mode: such as java.util.Collections#emptyList().
		* Observer mode: It allows an object to flexibly send messages to objects of interest, such as java.util.EventListener.
		* Template method pattern: Let subclasses override part of the method instead of the entire rewrite, such as java.util.Collections#sort().

* [Spring AOP Implementation Principles and CGLIB Applications] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-springaopcglib/)
	* The Spring AOP framework handles the AOP proxy class: If the target object's implementation class implements the interface, Spring AOP will use the JDK dynamic proxy to generate the AOP proxy class; if the target object's implementation class does not implement the interface, Spring AOP will Will use CGLIB to generate AOP proxy class

### Conway's Law
* ["Theoretical Foundation of Microservice Architecture - Conway's Law"] (https://yq.aliyun.com/articles/8611)
	* Law 1: Organizational communication will be expressed through system design, which means that the layout and organizational structure of the architecture will be similar.
	* Law 2: It is impossible to do one thing at a time, but there is always time to finish one thing. You can't eat a fat man in one breath, you can get it done first.
	* Law 3: There is a potential heterogeneous homomorphism between the linear system and the linear organization. Planting melons and melons, doing independent autonomous subsystems reduces communication costs.
	* Law 4: Large system organizations are always more prone to decomposition than small systems. The long-term must be divided, divided and ruled.

* ["Ngnix Basic Learning - Comparison of Multi-Process and Apache"] (https://blog.csdn.net/qq_25797077/article/details/52200722)
	* Nginx achieves high concurrency through asynchronous non-blocking event handling mechanisms. Apache monopolizes one thread per request, consuming system resources.
	* Event-driven is suitable for IO-intensive services (Nginx), multi-process or thread is suitable for CPU-intensive services (Apache), so Nginx is suitable for reverse proxy, not for web server.  

* ["Ninx vs. Apache vs. Advantages and Disadvantages"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/cunkouzh/p/5410154.html)
	* nginx is only suitable for static and reverse proxy and is not suitable for handling dynamic requests.

### OpenResty

### Tomcat

#### Architecture Principle
* ["The TOMCAT Principles and Request Process"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/hggen/p/6264475.html)
* ["Tomcat Server Principles"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/crazylqy/p/4706223.html)
* [Tomcat System Architecture and Design Patterns, Part 1: Working Principles] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-tomcat1/)

* ["Four pictures take you to understand the Tomcat system architecture"] (https://blog.csdn.net/xlgen157387/article/details/79006434)

* [《JBoss vs. Tomcat: Choosing A Java Application Server》](https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/jboss-vs-tomcat-choosing-a-java-application-server/)
	* Tomcat is a lightweight Serverlet container that does not implement all JEE features (such as persistence and transaction processing), but can be replaced by other components, such as Spring.
	* Jboss implements all JEE features, software open source free, documentation charges.

#### Tuning plan

* [Tomcat Tuning Solution] (https://www.cnblogs.com/sunfenqing/p/7339058.html)
	* Start NIO mode (or APR); adjust thread pool; disable AJP connector (Nginx+tomcat architecture, no AJP required); 

* ["tomcat http protocol and ajp agreement"] (http://blog.chinaunix.net/uid-20662363-id-3012760.html)
* ["AJP vs. HTTP Comparison and Analysis"] (http://dmouse.iteye.com/blog/1354527)
	* The AJP protocol (port 8009) is used to reduce the number of connections (front end) to the front-end server (such as Apache, and needs to support the AJP protocol) to improve performance over long connections.
	* When the concurrency is high, the AJP protocol is superior to the HTTP protocol.

### Jetty
* ["Jetty works and compares with Tomcat"] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-jetty/)
* ["Jetty and tomcat advantage comparison"] (https://blog.csdn.net/doutao6677/article/details/51957288)
	* Architecture comparison: Jetty's architecture is simpler than Tomcat's.
	* Performance comparison: Jetty and Tomcat performance difference is not big, Jetty default NIO end is more dominant in processing I / O requests, Tomcat uses BIO to handle I / O requests by default, Tomcat is suitable for handling a few very busy links, processing static Performance is poor when resources are used.
	* Other aspects: Jetty's application is faster, simple to modify, and better support for the new Servlet specification; Tomcat supports JEE and Servlet more comprehensively.

* ["In-depth understanding of the principle of Memcached"] (https://blog.csdn.net/chenleixing/article/details/47035453)
	* Use multiplexing technology to improve concurrency.
	* slab allocation algorithm: memcached allocates memory space to Slab, the default is 1MB. After being assigned to Slab, the slab is divided into chunks of the same size. Chunk is the memory space used to cache records. The size of the Chunk is incremented by 1.25 times by default. The advantage is that it will not apply for memory frequently and improve IO efficiency. The downside is that there will be a certain amount of memory waste.
* ["Memcached Software Working Principles"] (https://www.jianshu.com/p/36e5cd400580)

* ["The underlying principle of redis"] (https://blog.csdn.net/wcf373722432/article/details/78678504)
	* Using ziplist to store linked lists, ziplist is a compressed linked list, which has the advantage of saving memory space because it stores content in a contiguous memory area.
	* Use skiplist (jump table) to store ordered collection objects, look up from high level first, look up time complexity and red and black trees, easy to implement, no lock, good concurrency.
* [Redisend Persistence] (http://doc.redisfans.com/topic/persistence.html)
	* RDB mode: Backup snapshots regularly, often used for disaster recovery. Advantages: Backup by the process of fork does not affect the main process, RDB is faster than AOF when recovering large data sets. Disadvantages: Data will be lost.
	* AOF mode: Save the operation log mode. Advantages: Less data loss during recovery, disadvantages: large files, slow response.
	* It can also be used in combination.

### Three

* [Official Website] (https://github.com/alibaba/tair)
* ["Comparison of Tair and Redis"] (http://blog.csdn.net/farphone/article/details/53522383)
* Features: You can configure the number of backup nodes to synchronize to the backup node through asynchronous
* Consistent hash algorithm.
* Architecture: Similar to Hadoop's design philosophy, Configserver, DataServer, Configserver are detected by heartbeat, and Configserver also has an active/standby relationship.


Several storage engines:
* MDB, fully memory, can be used to store data such as Session.
* Rdb (similar to Redis), lightweight, removes operations such as aof, supports Restfull operations
* LDB (LevelDB storage engine), persistent storage, LDB as rdb persistence, google implementation, more efficient, the theoretical basis is LSM (Log-Structured-Merge Tree) algorithm, now modify the data in memory, when a certain amount ( Write the old data together with the memory summary to the disk) and then write to the disk, the storage is more efficient, the county metaphor Hash algorithm.
* Tair uses shared memory to store data. If the service hangs (non-server), after restarting the service, the data is still there.

## message queue

* ["Message Queue - Push/Pull Mode Learning & ActiveMQ and JMS Learning"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/charlesblc/p/6045238.html)
	* RabbitMQ consumers default to push mode (also supports pull mode).
	* Kafka defaults to pull mode.
	* Push mode: The advantage is that the message can be sent to the consumer as quickly as possible. The disadvantage is that if the consumer's processing power can't keep up, the consumer's buffer may overflow.
	* Pull mode: The advantage is that the consumer can pull according to the processing power, the disadvantage is that it will increase the message delay.

## Network Model

* ["Web optimization must understand the principles of the five models of I / o and the three working modes of the web"] (http://blog.51cto.com/litaotao/1289790)
	* Five I/O models: blocking I/O, non-blocking I/O, I/O multiplexing, event (signal) driving I/O, asynchronous I/O, the first four I/Os are synchronous operations, I The first phase of /O is different, the second phase is the same, and the last one is asynchronous.
	* Three Web Server working methods: Prefork (multi-process), Worker mode (thread mode), and Event mode.

* ["Summary of the differences between select, poll, and epoll"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/Anker/p/3265058.html)
	* select, poll, epoll are essentially synchronous I / O, because they all need to be responsible for reading and writing after the read and write events are ready, which means that the read and write process is blocked.
	* select has a limit on the number of open file descriptors, the default is 1024 (2048 for x64), 1 million concurrent, it is necessary to use 1000 processes, the switching overhead is large; poll uses a linked list structure, there is no limit.
	* select, poll "wake up" when traversing the entire fd collection, and epoll in the "wake up" just need to judge whether the ready list is empty, save a lot of CPU time through the callback mechanism; select, poll every call The fd collection must be copied from the user state to the kernel state once, and epoll only needs to be copied once.
	* Poll will increase with concurrent, performance will gradually decline, epoll adopts red and black tree structure, the performance is stable, and will not decrease as the number of connections increases.
	
* [《select，poll，epoll比较  》](http://xingyunbaijunwei.blog.163.com/blog/static/76538067201241685556302/)
	* In the case of a small number of connections and the connection is very active, the performance of select and poll may be better than epoll, after all, epoll's notification mechanism requires a lot of function callbacks.

* ["In-depth understanding of Java NIO"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/geason/p/5774096.html)

## Basic theory
### The three paradigms of relational database design
* ["Three Paradigms of the Database and Five Major Constraints"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/waj6511988/p/7027127.html)
	* First paradigm: Each column (each field) in the data table must be the smallest unit that cannot be split, that is, to ensure the atomicity of each column;
	* Second Normal Form (2NF): After satisfying 1NF, all the columns in the request table must depend on the primary key, and no column can be related to the primary key, that is, a table describes only one thing;
	* Third Normal Form: The second normal form (2NF) must be satisfied first. It is required that each column in the table is directly related to the primary key rather than indirectly (each column in the table can only depend on the primary key);

MyISAM is non-aggregated and InnoDB is aggregated

#### Composite Index

* ["Features and Considerations for Composite Indexes"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/summer0space/p/7247778.html)
	* There is a mistake in the text:
	> For composite indexes, when using the query, it is best to order the conditions in the order of the index, which is the most efficient; select * from table1 where col1=A AND col2=B AND col3=D If you use where col2=B AND col1= A or where col2=B will not use the index
	* The index mentioned in the original text is created in the order of "col1, col2, col3", and mysql is based on the index matching principle of the leftmost prefix, and the order of the where condition is automatically optimized. When the condition is only col2=B AND col1 When =A, it will automatically be converted to col1=A AND col2=B, so the index will still be used.

## Stability & High Availability

* [System Design: Some Technical Solutions for Highly Available Systems] (https://blog.csdn.net/hustspy1990/article/details/78008324)
	* Scalable: horizontal expansion, vertical expansion. Avoid redundant single points of failure.
	* Isolation: Avoid taking up all resources from a single business. Avoid interaction between services 2. Room isolation to avoid single points of failure.
	* Decoupling: Reduce maintenance costs and reduce coupling risk. Reduce dependence and reduce the impact on each other.
	* Current limiting: algorithms such as sliding window counting, leaky bucket algorithm, and token bucket algorithm. When the sudden flow is encountered, the system is guaranteed to be stable.
	* Downgrade: Release resources for non-core functions in an emergency. Sacrifice non-core services to ensure high availability of core business.
	* Fuse: An abnormal condition exceeds the threshold and enters the blown state, which quickly fails. Reduce the impact of unstable external dependencies on core services.
	* Automated testing: Reduce testing-induced failures through comprehensive testing.
	* Grayscale release: Grayscale publishing is a compromise between speed and security, which can effectively reduce release failures.


* ["About Highly Available Systems"] (https://coolshell.cn/articles/17459.html)
	* Design principle: data is not lost (persistent); service is highly available (service copy); absolute 100% high availability is difficult, the goal is to achieve as many as 9, such as 99.999% (only 5 minutes accumulated throughout the year) .

### Limiting

* ["Talk about the current limit of high concurrency system"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/haoxinyue/p/6792309.html)
	* Counter: Controls the number of requests per unit time by sliding the window counter, which is simple and rude.
	* Leaky bucket algorithm: a leaky bucket with a fixed capacity. If the leaky bucket is full, the request is discarded, which is more common.
	* Token bucket algorithm: A fixed-capacity token bucket, which adds a token according to a certain rate, needs to get a token before processing the request, discards the request if the token is not received, or enters the lost queue, which can be added by controlling the token. Rate to control the overall speed. The RateLimiter in Guava is an implementation of the token bucket.
	* Nginx current limit: limit the number of concurrent connections by modules such as `limit_req`.

### Application layer disaster tolerance

* ["Avalanche weapon: Principle and use of fuse Hystrix"] (https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000005988895)

	* Avalanche countermeasures: current limit, improved cache mode (cache preload, synchronous call to asynchronous), automatic expansion, and downgrade.
	* Hystrix design principles:
		* Resource isolation: Hystrix avoids service avalanches by allocating each dependent service to a separate thread pool for resource isolation.
		* Fuse switch: Health status of the service = number of request failures / total number of requests, control switch via threshold setting and sliding window.
		* Command mode: Wrap service call logic by inheriting HystrixCommand.

	* Can not rely on the double-write of the terminal data, there must be an automatic synchronization scheme. 
	* Data is never in high latency and poor network quality, considering synchronization quality issues.
	* Core and secondary businesses are divided and ruled, even considering core business.
	* More live monitoring and deployment, testing must also keep up.
	* Consider user partitions when the business allows, especially games and email services.
	* Control the size of the message body across the machine room, the smaller the better.

	* Advantages: API is simple, Pinterest, Airbnb is in use, multi-language, through the watcher mechanism to achieve configuration PUSH, can quickly respond to configuration changes. 

### Service Routing Control
* ["Distributed Service Framework Study Notes 4 Service Routing"] (https://blog.csdn.net/xundh/article/details/59492750)
	* Principle: Transparent routing
	* Load balancing strategy: random, polling, service call delay, consistent hash, sticky connection
	* Local routing priority policy: injvm (priority call jvm internal service), intermediate (prioritize the same physical machine service), in principle, find the nearest service.
	* Configuration mode: unified registry; local configuration; dynamic delivery.

## Distributed consistent

### CAP and BASE Theory

* ["Distributed Consistency on CAP Theory, BASE Theory"] (http://www.cnblogs.com/szlbm/p/5588543.html)
	* Consistency classification: strong consistency (immediately consistent); weak consistency (can be consistent in unit time, such as second level); final agreement (weakly consistent one, eventually consistent within a certain period of time)
	* CAP: consistency, availability, partition fault tolerance (caused by network failure)
	* BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventually consistent
	* The core idea of ​​BASE theory is that even if strong consistency cannot be achieved, each application can use the appropriate method to achieve the final consistency of the system according to its own business characteristics.

### Distributed lock

* ["Several Implementations of Distributed Locks"] (http://www.hollischuang.com/archives/1716)
	* Database-based distributed locks: advantages: easy to operate and easy to understand. Disadvantages: There is a single point problem, database performance can be expensive, and can not be reentrant;
	* Cache-based distributed locks: Advantages: non-blocking, good performance. Disadvantages: Poor operation can easily cause the lock to be released.
	* Zookeeper distributed lock: The locking mechanism is implemented by the ordered temporary node, and the corresponding node needs to be the smallest, it is considered to be the lock. Advantages: The cluster can solve the single point problem transparently, avoiding the problem that the lock is not released, and the lock can be reentered. Disadvantages: Performance is not as good as caching, and throughput will decrease as the zk cluster grows larger.

#设计思想与开发模式

## DDD(Domain-driven Design - Domain Driven Design)

* ["On my understanding of DDD domain driver design"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/netfocus/p/5548025.html)
  * Concept: DDD is mainly proposed for the separation of stages in the traditional software development process (analysis-design-encoding), avoiding software failures due to unclear analysis at the outset or inconsistent information flow during software development (and requirements) The problem is conceived by the party. DDD emphasizes that everything is centered on the domain, emphasizing the role of Domain Expert, emphasizing that development is done after the domain model is first defined, and the domain model can guide development (so-called drivers).
  * Process: understanding the field, splitting the field, refining the field, the accuracy of the model depends on the depth of understanding of the model.
  * Design: Modeling tools such as aggregations, entities, value objects, factories, warehousing, domain services, and domain events are proposed in DDD to aid domain modeling.
  
* ["Basic Knowledge of Domain-Driven Design"] (https://www.cnblogs.com/butterfly100/p/7827870.html)
  * Domain (Doamin) is essentially a problem domain, such as an e-commerce system, a forum system, and so on.
  * Bounded Context: Explains the relationship between subdomains, which can be easily understood as a subsystem or component module.
  * Domain Model: The core of DDD is to establish the correct domain model (using a common description language, tools - domain common language); to reflect the nature of business requirements, including entities and processes; through software analysis, design, development The entire process; the way in which the domain model is commonly used: diagrams, code or text;
  * Domain common language: domain experts or developers can have immediate language or tools.
  * Classic layered architecture: user interface / presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, infrastructure layer, is a four-tier architecture mode.
  * Mode used:
    * Minimize the association, try to be single item, and try to reduce the overall complexity.
    * Entity: A unique identifier in a field. The attributes of an entity are as small as possible, and less are clear.
    * Value Object: There is no unique identifier, and the property value is immutable. The second is a simple object, such as Date.
    * Domain Service: Coordinating multiple domain objects, only methods have no state (no data); can be divided into application layer services, domain layer services, and base layer services.
    * Aggregate, Aggregate Root: Aggregate defines a set of related objects with a cohesive relationship; the aggregate root is the only element that references the aggregate; when modifying an aggregate, it must be at the transaction level; In the domain model, 70% of aggregates usually have only one entity, 30% have only 2~3 entities; if an aggregate has only one entity, then this entity is the aggregate root; if there are multiple entities, then we can think about which one in the aggregate Objects have an independent meaning and can interact directly with the outside;
    * Factory: Similar to the factory mode in design mode.
    * Repository: Persist to DB, manage objects, and only design storage for aggregates.

* [The Road to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation] (http://www.cnblogs.com/Leo_wl/p/3866629.html)
	* Aggregation: For example, a car contains components such as an engine, a wheel, and a tank.

### Command Query Separation of Duties (CQRS)

CQRS — Command Query Responsibility Seperation

* ["Domain Driven Design Series (6): CQRS]] (https://www.cnblogs.com/cnblogsfans/p/4551990.html)
	* Core idea: read-write separation (query and update in different methods), different processes are just different design methods, CQ code separation, obvious manifestation in distributed environment (with redundant data), purpose It is for high performance.

* [Comparison of Advantages and Disadvantages of DDD CQRS Architecture and Traditional Architecture] (http://www.techweb.com.cn/network/system/2017-07-07/2553563.shtml)

### Anemia, congestion model

* ["Anemia, explanation of the congestion model and some experiences"] (https://kb.cnblogs.com/page/520743/)
	* Blood loss model: Laozi and his son are defined separately, and they do not know each other. There is no business logic in the definition of the two entities, and the association is performed through the external Service.
	* Anemia model: Laozi knows his son, son also knows Laozi; part of the business logic is placed in the entity; advantages: each layer is dependent on each item, the structure is clear, easy to maintain; disadvantages: not in line with OO thinking, compared to the congestion mode, the Service layer is more Thick
	* Congestive model: Similar to the anemia model, the difference is how to divide the business logic. Advantages: The Service layer is relatively thin, only acts as a Facade, does not deal with DAO, composite OO ideas; Disadvantages: non-single dependency, bidirectional dependency between DO and DAO, and logical division of Service layer can easily cause confusion.
	* Swollen mode: It is an extreme situation, the Service layer is removed, and all business logic is placed in the DO; Advantages: OO thinking is met, stratification is simplified; Disadvantages: Excessive exposure information, many non-DO logic will also be forced into DO . This mode should be avoided.
	* The author advocates the use of anemia mode.

### Strictly abide by the Criminal Law 253 Law

One of the provisions of Article 253 of the Criminal Law of China states:

> * State organs or staff of financial, telecommunications, transportation, education, medical and other units, in violation of state regulations, sell or illegally provide personal information obtained by the unit in the course of performing duties or providing services to others. In the case of imprisonment for up to three years or criminal detention, or a single penalty.
> * Stealing or illegally obtaining the above information in other ways. If the circumstances are serious, the punishment shall be imposed in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. 
> * If the unit commits the first two crimes, it shall impose a fine on the unit, and the person in charge directly responsible for it and other directly responsible personnel shall be punished according to the provisions of each paragraph.

The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate's Supplementary Provisions on the Implementation of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China (4) stipulates that: the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 253 of the Criminal Law constitute the crime of "selling or illegally providing citizens with personal information"; Violation of the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 253 of the Criminal Law constitutes "the crime of illegally obtaining citizen's personal information"

### Safe Harbor Principle
The "safe haven" principle means that when a copyright infringement case occurs, when the ISP (network service provider) only provides space services and does not create web content, if the ISP is notified of the infringement, there is an obligation to delete, otherwise it is regarded as infringement. . If the infringing content is not stored on the ISP's server and is not told which content should be deleted, the ISP does not assume tort liability. Later, the safe haven principle was also applied to search engines, network storage, online libraries and so on.
